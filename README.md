## Ulauncher Theme
Simply download the folder `Ulauncher_ZorinBlue-Light` from the repo and place it in `/home/'USER ID'/.config/ulauncher/user-themes` in your linux installation. Now select the theme in Ulauncher from the `Preferences Tab>Color Theme` option and the theme gets applied.

## Peazip Theme
Download the file <code><a href="https://github.com/Ansh4011/Zorin-Theme-Implementations/raw/main/Peazip_ZorinBlue-Light/Zorin_PeaZip_Theme.theme.7z">Zorin_PeaZip_Theme.theme.7z</a></code> (from the `Peazip_ZorinBlue-Light` folder). Now open peazip and go to `Options>Settings>Theme` and select the theme as `Custom` which opens a file browser, now locate and select the theme you just downloaded and click on open. Now click on ok. That's it!

##  Monkeytype.com Theme
<a href="https://monkeytype.com/">MonkeyType.com</a> is an awesome website for testing and practicing 'typing' and I personally love it, so just created a zorin theme for it. 
Here's the link for the same- https://monkeytype.com/?customTheme=WyIjZjVmN2ZhIiwiIzA2YTFlYyIsIiMxYTI2MzMiLCIjOTViMGMzIiwiI2U0ZThlZSIsIiMxNzFkMjAiLCIjZmY1MjVkIiwiI2ZmMzEzMyIsIiNmZjUyNWQiLCIjZmYzMTMzIl0=

## Extra Themings
1. Flatpak App Theming- https://itsfoss.com/flatpak-app-apply-theme/
2. Chromium based browsers support gtk theming, but it has to be switched on manually. For example- In Brave you go to `Settings>Appearance` and simply click on the button saying `Use GTK+` and the gtk theming get's enabled.
3. Old Zorin-OS desktop themes meant for `v20.04` work pretty well with `v22.04` (PopOS in my case) although not 100% perfect afterall they're meant for an older version of GTK, but you can barely see any inconsistency.
4. You can theme Spotify via Spicetify. Zorin based theme for the same is available here- https://github.com/schnensch0/ziro
5. Theme for Discord is also available (via BetterDiscord). Link to that theme- https://github.com/schnensch0/zelk
6. The login manager (GDM) can be themed too. Tool I used for that purpose- https://github.com/realmazharhussain/gdm-tools
